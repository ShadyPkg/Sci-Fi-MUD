Open Source Science Fiction MUD in Java.

Update 10/3/15:
Applet is now completed and is ready to be deployed on the web. Players can login and choose class. They can move around the map and take items, examine items, remove items, and wear equipment. There is also monsters on the map but no interaction with them yet. There is a basic text file system that can acts like a database to store all player information, equipment information and NPC information.

After trying for 2 days to host an applet on Amazon web services and on localhost using Tomcat I could not by pass all the security issues that Firefox and other browsers impose on Java. It is very clear now that Java is difficult to use for the web. Because of this I will no longer be making any major updates to this project.

The good news is that we will be migrating to AJAX technology to develop our Sci-Fi MUD. This does mean a lot of code will have to be redone but it in the long run it will help us get our MUD to the online multiplayer stage.
