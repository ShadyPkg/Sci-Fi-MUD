# Sci-Fi-MUD

Here is where we can discuss ideas for the Sci-FI MUD game. 
For now this will be a single player game that is run on a terminal. 
Maybe later we can make it multiplayer. These are ideas and are not set in stone.
The four programming languages we can implement this MUD in would be C, C++, Java
or Python. Vote on which language you want to implement the game in.
We also need ideas for a storyline. I will add more classes as time goes on.
Feel free to suggest new things.
